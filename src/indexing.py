# Step 2. [10 points] Indexing: Build an inverted index, with an entry for each word in the vocabulary. 
# You can use any appropriate data structure (hash table, linked lists, Access database, etc.). 
# An example of possible index is presented below. Note: if you use an existing IR system, use its indexing mechanism.

# Input: Tokens obtained from the preprocessing module

# Output: An inverted index for fast access
