# Step 3. [10 points] Retrieval and Ranking:  Use the inverted index (from step 2) to find the 
# limited set of documents that contain at least one of the query words. Compute the cosine 
# similarity scores between a query and each document. 

# Input: One query and the Inverted Index (from Step2)

# Output: Similarity values between the query and each of the documents. Rank the documents in decreasing order of similarity scores.
